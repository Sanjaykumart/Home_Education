				<u><h3>About Us</h3></u>
				
				<p>
					Digital Learning is education distributed on a digital device in any setting, such as classrooms, conference rooms, manufacturing facilities, at a desk, or home.

Online Learning refers to courses delivered online. These are modules that contain content, interactivity, simulations, and quizzes that a user interacts with directly. 
In the past, these have also been called Computer-Based Training (CBT) or Web-Based Training (WBT) though “eLearning” is generally considered the contemporary term and encapsulates both.

eLearning employs technology to facilitate, enhance, and expand educational content, access, and the tracking of training progress. 
Developed initially as a computer-based content delivery system for schools, eLearning is now embraced by all types of organizations, from large businesses to start-ups, government, non-profits, and trade associations. 
The top industries using eLearning include Healthcare, Technology, Retail and eCommerce, Education, and Construction.
Today, eLearning means much more than just delivering information. 
Available on a variety of digital devices, from desktop computers to smartphones and other handheld devices, eLearning is interactive and on-demand, which significantly increases learning engagement and retention.
