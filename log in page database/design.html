				<u><h3>Design</h3></u>
		
				<p>
					This school website has a unique and professional touch to it.
					It has a hover over drop down menu for each of the sections of 
					the header menu. The website doesnâ€™t have a lot of content, the 
					images speak for themselves. The footer menu is different and 
					interesting.
				</p>
				
				<p>

					The Font style used is consistent throughout the entire website 
					which adds to the professional touch. The entire website consists 
					of 3 flat colors.
