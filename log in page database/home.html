				<u><h3>What is Home Education</h3></u>
		
				<p>
					Home education involves teaching your children at home instead of in a traditional school 
					environment. Parents have practiced home education since the beginning of public and private 
					schooling.

					There are several types of home education involving both parents and tutors. Home education 
					offers a range of benefits for students, including potentially higher exam and test scores 
					and the ability to learn at a more controlled pace.

					Along with these benefits, there are also challenges to home education. Most parents that 
					educate their children at home use study and teaching programmes to cover the widest range of 
					subjects at a high level of depth and understanding.
